# More Renewables (Minecraft datapack)
###### Creates crafting/cooking recipes for items that are otherwise not renewable or are very hard to make renewable.
This datapack is primarily aimed at versions of SkyBlock or other similar survival maps where players wouldn't be able to obtain a
lot of differnt items simply because they didn't generate. This also applies to Superflat, and also to Peaceful to a lesser extent.
It also works to eliminate the need for RNG-dependant elements, such as villager trading and bartering, to reliably obtain certain
things, like clay, which can drop as a reward for warding off raids. I try to keep the crafting at least somewhat logical, and to
keep these obtaining methods rather tame, such that in a fully generated world, the player is still better off exploring, compared
to using this datapack, but to still make it a viable alternative. Additionally, I don't intend on creating a crafting recipe for
everything, just the base materials necessary for everything else, and even then with exceptions; and no crafting unobtainable
blocks like Nether Portals or Bedrock.
#### If you feel like you only need part of this datapack, the folders are structured such that recipes that are made for Peaceful or SkyBlock in specific can be removed by removing their respective folders.
